  Hi, I'm <span className="name">Pavithra</span>,<br />
  A passionate and self-driven web developer with a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering. Despite transitioning from a non-IT background, I have worked diligently to build a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL, while expanding my skills in modern frameworks like ReactJS and backend technologies like NodeJS and ExpressJS.<br /><br />
  My journey into tech is fueled by consistent preparation, hands-on learning, and an unwavering dedication to growth. Through hard work and perseverance, I've successfully carved a space for myself in the world of web development.<br /><br />
